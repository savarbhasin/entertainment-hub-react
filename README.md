## Entertainment Hub Site
Welcome to the Entertainment Hub Site! This is a web application built using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. The site provides information about trending movies and TV shows, allowing users to search for their favorite movies and TV shows. In addition, there are some features and improvements planned for the future.

## Features
- Trending Movies/TV Shows: The site displays a list of trending movies and TV shows, allowing users to stay updated with the latest releases.
- Search Functionality: Users can easily search for movies and TV shows by entering relevant keywords. The site provides search suggestions as users type.
- Pagination: The site supports pagination to display a large number of search results. However, there are known issues with the pagination functionality, and sometimes it may fail. This issue will be addressed in future updates.
- Responsive Design: The site is responsive and can be accessed on various devices. However, improvements can be made to enhance the responsiveness further.
- Genre Filtering: Users can choose from a list of genres to filter the movies and TV shows. This feature allows users to discover content based on their preferred genres.

## Planned Improvements
- Modal for Movie Details: One of the planned improvements is to add a modal that provides additional information about a movie when clicked. This feature will enhance the user experience by allowing them to view more details without leaving the current page.

- Watch Later Tab using Redux: Another enhancement in progress is the addition of a "Watch Later" tab. This feature will utilize Redux to allow users to save movies or TV shows they are interested in and access them later.
